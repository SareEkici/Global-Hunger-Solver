## About the Project

Hunger Solver is an AI-powered platform designed to reduce global food waste and help combat hunger around the world.

While millions of tons of food are wasted every year, many regions still face serious food shortages. This project aims to bridge that gap by efficiently redirecting surplus food to the areas that need it most.

## Our Solution

Our platform analyzes surplus food sources and areas in need using a data-driven approach. AI algorithms consider the quantity, type, and expiration dates of surplus food to match it with regions facing shortages in the most effective way.

By doing so, we reduce food waste and ensure that resources are utilized where they have the greatest impact. Additionally, logistics processes are optimized to minimize transportation costs and delivery times.

## Role of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence helps by analyzing large and complex datasets to:

- Predict the amounts and types of surplus food available,  
- Assess the hunger levels and demand in different regions,  
- Match suppliers of surplus food with recipients in need efficiently,  
- Optimize shipping routes and delivery schedules.  

This approach enables faster and more accurate decision-making in situations where human capacity is limited by data complexity and scale.
