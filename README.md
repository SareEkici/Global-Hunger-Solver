## Our Solution

Our platform uses a **data-driven approach** to analyze surplus food sources and areas in need. AI algorithms consider:

*️⃣ Quantity of surplus food  
*️⃣ Type and expiration dates  
*️⃣ Matching surplus with areas of shortage

This leads to **reduced waste** and **optimized resource use**. Logistics are fine-tuned to minimize costs and delivery times 🚚⏳.

## Role of Artificial Intelligence 🤖

Artificial intelligence tackles complex data by:

1️⃣ Predicting available surplus food types and amounts  
2️⃣ Assessing hunger levels and demands regionally  
3️⃣ Efficiently matching suppliers with recipients  
4️⃣ Optimizing shipping routes and schedules

> **Result:** Faster, smarter decisions that manual methods can’t achieve.
